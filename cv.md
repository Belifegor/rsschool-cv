### Briefly About Myself:
  I work as a system administrator at CRM Genesys and making settings for NLU Omilia chat-bot. My work partially overlaps with the Javascript language, which sparked my interest in learning. I like that a front-end developer has growth prospects and I hope to become one. I liked the activity of the RS School community and I want to become a part of it, perhaps in the future I will be able to help other students.
